## Neural Network PC Visualize
This sub-folder focus on tools for calculating and analyzing the PC structures of CNNs: How the activation of their
 feature vectors distribute in response to natural images?
 
 Here we used Validation set of ImageNet2012 as the stimuli set and characterize the feature vector manifold of
  networks like ResNet50 robust etc. 
  
 We further visualize the content of those PC dimensions by cosine evolution.
